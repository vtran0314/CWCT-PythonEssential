#Program name: Weight on Other Planets
#Description:
#  Design a Python program that asks a user for their name and weight.
#  The program will greet the user by name and then calculate/display the user's weight on the other planets.
#  Each item should be displayed on a line by itself.

# Use the following values for the conversions

# Body    Multiple of Earthâ€™s Gravity
# Sun     27.01
# Mercury 0.38
# Venus   0.91
# Earth   1 (defined)
# Moon    0.166
# Mars    0.38
# Jupiter 2.34
# Saturn  1.06
# Uranus  0.92
# Neptune 1.19
# Pluto   0.06
#
